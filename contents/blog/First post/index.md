Hello everyone 😃 Welcome to my site. I'm so happy i can release my own websites after 5 months of busy work. This will be my first post.

Therefore i wanted to introduce myself 🎉🎉🎉

As you may know from my about page, i'm a 19 y.o boy who loves to code & Open Source. but you may be wonder why i did'nt have portofolio.
Well, long story short i accidentally removed them all in my past. Because in those times i feel the project i was making is not great enough for my portofolio so i just removed it 😅. But man, i regret it now, realizing that my past projects actually pretty good😭.

You may not believe in me but i have worked on several newbie projects actually, some of them are a blog pages for local village government. It was a project by a college student majoring in CS, but they did'nt have coding skill (yes, this is truly unexpected).

My second project was a chats app. but i did'nt ever finished it due to some reason(actually in that time i just knew about react and goes all out for learning it LOL).

Anyways that's all i can remember, the other is'nt really good, just some experimental projects.

Currently i'm working at [Assist ID](https://assist.id) as a Frontend Developer. we use react everyday ✌🏻 Big thanks for folks at Facebook for creating this lovely frameworks 🥰🥰🥰. For you that don't know who or what is Assist ID, it's a startup that have business model for empowering clinics and hospital in Indonesia to become more efficient in handling their administrations.

My favorite dish is a Bakso!🤩 You can think of it's like a Meatball but somehow looks like ramen🧐. It's super delicious, especially the spicy one🥵.

<span style="color: grey">Very delicious if you ask me</span>
</div>

I have contributed to several open source projects, including [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) and [Webiny-js](https://webiny.com), but still just some good first issues. But i'm trying my best to level up😁. You can look more in my [Github](https://github.com/ahmad-reza619) for more contributions that i made👀. Maybe in the future there will be a lot of projects and i hope i can be a maintainer🤩(it's my little dream).

So anyway, nice to meet you everyone, and welcome to my websites. hope you enjoyed it 💃🏻💃🏻
